# Be Knowledgeable. Be Free. Be Independent. Be Capable.

An open-source knowledge platform for methods, lessons, natural science, social science, and guided learning works.

The project begins with Markdown-based knowledge content, a lightweight React/Vite frontend, a minimal FastAPI backend, and a path toward AI tutor support that is not locked to one AI company.

## MVP Scope

- Homepage manifesto.
- Methods & Lessons.
- Knowledge section.
- Computer Science starter content.
- Marxism / Political Economy starter content.
- Archive of Sparks Chapter 0 prototype.
- Optional AI tutor backend skeleton.

## Run Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend reads the backend URL from `apps/web/.env`:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

By default, the backend can run with AI disabled:

```bash
AI_PROVIDER=disabled
```

Hosted or external AI providers should be called from the backend, not directly from the browser, so API keys are not exposed.

## Local Development Commands

You can start both development servers with:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

The script starts both services, waits until they respond, and automatically opens
the website in your default browser:

- Backend: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Frontend: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

Running the command again reuses services already running from this checkout
and opens the website again.
If only one service is running, it starts the missing service. Ports occupied by
another project are reported without stopping that project's processes.
Press Ctrl+C to stop services started by the current command; reused services
continue running in their original terminal.

If setup is incomplete, it prints the manual commands to run.

Manual backend:

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Manual frontend:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

## Build Commands

Build the frontend and check backend imports:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

Manual frontend build:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run build
```

Manual backend import check:

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. python -c "import main; print(main.app.title)"
```

## Local Checks

Run:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh
```

This checks:

- Node and npm versions.
- Python version.
- Backend health endpoint if the backend is already running.
- Whether `apps/web/dist/index.html` exists.
- Required environment example files.

## AI Provider Switching

The backend uses a provider abstraction in `backend/services/ai/`. Routes call `provider_factory.get_ai_provider()` instead of calling OpenAI directly.

For local development without AI calls:

```bash
ENABLE_AI=true
AI_PROVIDER=disabled
```

To use OpenAI:

```bash
ENABLE_AI=true
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini
```

Future providers can be added behind the same `AIProvider.generate()` interface, including Ollama, local open-source models, and community model nodes. This prevents vendor lock-in because frontend and route code do not depend on one company's SDK or response format.

## Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repository or create a branch.
2. Edit content or code.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Open a pull request.

## Repository Map

- `docs/`: vision, governance, and architecture notes.
- `content/`: Markdown knowledge content and guided learning works.
- `apps/web/`: React/Vite frontend MVP.
- `backend/`: FastAPI backend skeleton and AI provider abstraction.
- `ai-lab/`: future local, open-source, and decentralized AI experiments.
- `scripts/`: future project automation scripts.
- `docker/`: future container and deployment files.

## Content Structure

The `content/` folder is the Git-backed knowledge base. It starts with:

- `content/methods-and-lessons/`: learning methods, experience lessons, and collaboration notes.
- `content/knowledge/computer-science/`: computer science starter content, including algorithms.
- `content/knowledge/marxism-political-economy/`: Marxism, political economy, and scientific socialism starter content.
- `content/works/archive-of-sparks/`: guided learning narrative content for Archive of Sparks.

Markdown pages should stay small at first: title, short description, placeholder sections, TODO markers, and links to related pages.

## Basic Troubleshooting

- Frontend cannot reach backend:
  - Confirm backend is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
  - Check `apps/web/.env` has `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
  - Restart the Vite dev server after changing `.env`.
- Backend import or startup fails:
  - Recreate the virtual environment if needed.
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside `backend/.venv`.
  - Start from the `backend/` directory with `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
- AI features show disabled or unavailable messages:
  - This is expected when AI is disabled or no provider key is configured.
  - Check `ENABLE_AI`, `AI_PROVIDER`, and provider-specific environment variables.
- Frontend build folder is missing:
  - Run `cd apps/web && npm run build`.
- Port already in use:
  - Stop the existing backend or frontend process, or run the service manually on another port.

## Open Meeting Room

The `/meetings` page provides the community discussion MVP:

- public and invitation-only rooms;
- guest identities without a required account;
- up to 100 participants per room;
- host/moderator roles and a hand-raise queue;
- speaker promotion, demotion, and server-enforced microphone permission;
- realtime room state and text chat over WebSocket;
- SQLite persistence for room/chat history;
- optional self-hosted LiveKit audio.

### Automated meeting checks

```bash
./scripts/check-meetings.sh
```

This runs the backend meeting tests and the frontend TypeScript/Vite production build.

### Local audio development

Docker is used only for the local LiveKit SFU; the normal frontend and backend
remain in the existing development workflow.

```bash
./scripts/dev-meeting-audio.sh
```

Then open two browser sessions at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/meetings
```

A practical audio smoke test is:

1. Create a room as the host in the first browser session.
2. Join from a second/incognito browser session.
3. Click **Connect audio** in both sessions.
4. Raise the listener's hand and promote that participant to speaker.
5. Unmute the promoted speaker and verify audio plus the speaking indicator.
6. From the host, mute the speaker and confirm publication is revoked.
7. Demote the speaker and confirm the microphone can no longer publish.

Stop the local SFU when finished:

```bash
./scripts/stop-meeting-audio.sh
```

The `devkey` / `secret` pair used by this workflow is LiveKit's development-mode
placeholder credential pair. Never use it for a public or production deployment.
